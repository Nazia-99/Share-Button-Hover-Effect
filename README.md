# Share Button Hover Effect

A clean and responsive **Share Button Hover Animation** built using pure HTML and CSS.  
Perfect for blog posts, card layouts, or interactive UI components.

✅ How It Works -
** Uses transform and opacity to animate social icons.
** Each .social-button a appears with a delay using transition-delay.
** .button-content shrinks and moves upward on hover using
** transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.4).

Clean use of flex for alignment and z-index layering.
